## Abstract

Historically considered of secondary importance, the corn stunt disease complex, caused by mollicutes and viruses, has recently become an increasing concern in Brazil. In this study, we assessed the relationship between disease severity (1–6 ordinal scale) and corn yield (kg/ha). Data from 22 independent field trials conducted across 10 municipalities in Paraná over two seasons were analyzed. The data were combined using a mixed-effects model to estimate both the attainable yield and the yield decline rate associated with disease severity. Heterogeneity among studies was explored through the influence of four moderator variables: yield class, severity class, hybrid tolerance, and hybrid susceptibility. Only yield class significantly explained variation among studies. The estimated global attainable yield was 8,229.03 kg/ha, with a yield decline rate of −1,043 kg per unit increase in disease score. On average, each additional point on the severity scale corresponded to a -12.3% yield reduction, reaching up to -63% at the highest severity level. However, for low-yield hybrids, the model estimates a −12.6% reduction per severity point, whereas for high-yield hybrids, the reduction was −7.4% per point. These findings highlight the substantial impact of the corn stunt disease complex on yield.

 I'm **Marcelo Gonçalves**, a Brazilian PhD candidate in Plant Pathology (UFV). I have conducted research in the molecular and population biology of plant viruses. Nowadays, I am using modeling and remote sensing to study the epidemiology of the corn stunt complex disease, caused by viruses and mollicutes.
